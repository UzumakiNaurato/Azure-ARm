# Nested Template Sample Using relativePath

This sample shows how to use a relativePath for the location of nested templates.  This property can be used in lieu of an absolute path once templates have been staged to a location for deployment.

If the template is used as a templateSpec, the same property can be used without changes to the template and Azure will handle the "staging" of the template during the deployment of the templateSpec.
